# Introduction 
I am only doin g the consolidation document with the extended time. Throughout this consolidation document I will try and show how I have engaged with the module materials and met the learning outcomes.

## Fail
A major fail for this module was my lack of interaction with other students, while I did make some annotations this week, they did little to truly interact with what other students were saying.
## Win
What feels like a big win for this module is the fact that I actually managed to interact with at least one of the tasks each week, to varying degrees of success. I interacted the least with the Data Service task, but I actively engaged with the Sharing Authority hieroglyph task as well as the Archeogaming task.
## Challenges
On the topic of the hieroglyphic task, a challenge I ran in to, which I discussed briefly in my notes for the week, was how it was hard to feel confident in my work and the results I got from it as I wasn't even sure of where to start translating from the image I was using. In addition to this my results seemed somewhat questionable. Which I will include an image of this result on the github.
## Implications?
To go further in depth about what occurred throughout this module. 
For week 9, in response to the feedback given, the ability to thoroughly convey and communicate what one has done to gather the data they have gained, as well as the process(es) used to categorize and/or catalogue this data and how it was presented not only gives those viewing the data ways to better understand it as well as be able to notice potential flaws, use this information to potentially improve their own work going forward, or better use the data for work of their own; it also allows the person communicating this information to take time and review what they have done and notice any errors they may have made during their process and allow them to address and correct them.
In regards to week 10 and the feedback given the sharing of research has potential consequences and in regards to what we have done in the course, this notion is incredibly relevant in regards to the grave memorial task. One needs to be contientious of who their research will affect and how sharing it will impact those people and how other people percieve and interact with them.
Lastly, with week 11, specifically regarding the feedback, the game that I used to take some memorials from was Bloodborne, which in the context of the feedback, in particular where you stated "...something to consider is to see how the design of those graves (and the designers’ concept of what constitutes ‘mourning’) is realized, since it does tell us something about ourselves (imagined as north american, I assume). If we think about both who designed these, and what models they’re drawing on, and what they’re meant to convey..." Why this is interesting is because Bloodborne is a game made by the game studio From Software (often shortened to From Soft), which is a Japanese game studio responsible for Bloodborne as well as other hit video games such as the Dark Souls trilogy, Sekiro, and Demon Souls. This is especially interesting when viewing the memorials in Bloodborne as the game has a very distinct Victorian era aesthetic to it, as well as, albeit it somewhat spoilery of a topic to say, Lovecraftian iconography. I debated using one of these more eldritch memorials but felt it would be too far removed from the point of the task as the intent behind their creation would be to actively make them feel inhuman. So instead I used some of the first memorials you would see from the game's base hub area. Thus the memorials I was cataloguing were a Japanese recreation of Victorian style grave monuments.
## Previous Feedback
In regards to previous feedback and how I responded I have utilized a more solid scheduling of my work throughout this module which allowed me to have time to more thoroughly interact with the tasks than I had in the previous modules. In regards to my feedback within this week, there was less feedback regarding how to improve my work and more suggestions and recommendations for how to view what was done during the week. I tried to address these comments throughout the implications section.

## Changes I'm making moving forward
Moving forward while not building on anything within the context of the class I will take what I have learned and I will view the remainder of my Classics and Archaeology oriented courses with this knowledge in mind.
## Evolution
I think first and foremost, throughout this course my idea and understanding of what archaeology is and can be has drastically increased in scale. In addition to this increased scope of what constitutes archaeology, I have grown to appreciate the complexity and the amount of work that goes in to the digitization of archaeology as a whole.
